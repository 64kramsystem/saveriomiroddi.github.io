Unexpectedly, the SQL Standard (ISO/IEC 9075) documents, while public, are not free - they're copyrighted, and available for purchase.

Still, some versions can be found on the web. PostgreSQL has a related section [in their wiki](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ#Where_can_I_get_a_copy_of_the_SQL_standards.3F), however, one link is out of date.

This is the up to date list of the documents, stored in the Wayback Machine, so that they're permanent:

- [1992 (draft, txt)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190616232635/www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt)
- [1999 (part 2, pdf)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823234942/courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs123/sql99std/ansi-iso-9075-2-1999.pdf)
- [2003 (zip)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181215222933/www.wiscorp.com/sql_2003_standard.zip)
- [2011 (preliminary, zip)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190616232242/www.wiscorp.com/sql20nn.zip)

For reference, the most relevant part is #2.
