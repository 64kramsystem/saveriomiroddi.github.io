Yesterday, I've officially released my [ZFS Ubuntu installer](https://github.com/saveriomiroddi/zfs-installer).

This project will hopefully help the adoption of ZFS, at least by appealing curious/interested sysadmins.

Canonical is about to officially release an Ubuntu with built-in ZFS support, however, it has extremely limited functionality.

Create a VM, [launch the program](https://github.com/saveriomiroddi/zfs-installer#instructions), and have fun playing with ZFS!
