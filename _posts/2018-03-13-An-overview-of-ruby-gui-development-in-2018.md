Ruby GUI development is a seldom mentioned subject, but it has value. Probably after some Rails development (cough...), developing a desktop tool may be an interesting diversion (or even a requirement).

During the development of my [PM-Spotlight](https://github.com/saveriomiroddi/pm-spotlight) desktop application, I evaluated most of the Desktop Ruby GUI toolkits, and prototyped the application with three of them (Shoes 3, FXRuby, and Tk).

This article presents a summary of what I've experienced (or gathered) while I was "Developing GUI applications with Ruby"!

## Update

This article is officially archived (I won't update it any more).

In a somewhat paradoxical way, I expect its contents to remain valid for a long time, since the main (not all!) Ruby GUI binding libraries are developed slowly/very slowly - if ever developed.

After the experience on my project, my personal conclusion is that the use cases for Ruby GUI development are increasingly smaller; these are the issues I've experienced:

- the slow startup time (with the Ruby "pseudo-standard" Tk library) forced me to develop a client/server architecture, which is necessary overengineering;
- having a CPU-intensive background task hurts significantly the GUI responsiveness due to the Ruby GIL;
- using forking as a parallelization remedy caused unexpected behavior of the forked processes (likely, GUI processes don't play well with forking).

The focus on GUI development nowadays has been eclipsed by web development; therefore, developing a GUI application, independently of the programming language, is a sort of bet - any GUI binding library could cease development at any time, or have too much of a slow development pace.

In general terms, if a project is small, there's little advantage in using Ruby rather than a more "complex" language. As a project grows in size, Ruby's simplicity loses over the problems that its GUI development suffers. Distribution also becomes a factor: statically-linked languages like Golang greatly simplify it.

Therefore, nowadays, based on very generic (and underinformed) considerations, I'd suggest people to try Golang+Qt, with the disclaimer that the stability of the library needs to be carefully evaluated.

## TL;DR: The summary

Reference table:

| Framework       | Distribution | Functionality | Documentation | Widgets     | Status                  |
|-------------    |--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Shoes 3         | good         | poor          | so-so         | lightweight | Active                  |
| Shoes 4         | good         | poor          | poor          | native      | Active                  |
| FXRuby          | good         | good          | good          | lightweight | Active                  |

Other projects, which haven't been assessed for any reason (activity/platforms/etc.):

- Ruby-QML: supports MacOS and Linux, but not Windows;
- RubyMotion: supports MacOS + mobile, but not Windows/Linux;
- Opal/Flammarion: browser-based.

This is certainly a reductionist view, so it's crucial to read to full article to get a grasp.

### Notes about platforms/toolkits

- Almost all the toolkits are based on the MRI (except those explicitly based on JRuby, and Shoes 4); compatibility with other interpreters is not specified;
- I did not prototype my application with half of the libraries, so for those, I only evaluated what I could gather by reading the documentation or what's implicit in the platform; I've marked such judgments with a question mark.

### Notes about evaluation

- The distribution refers to the main desktop platforms: Linux, MacOS and Windows;
- The widgets implementation is listed in this table, but not referenced in the evaluations, because in the current landscape, the other aspects are significantly more pressuring; also, native widgets are not necessarily better than lightweight;
- I didn't consider ease of development;
- I didn't consider the size of the packages, as in the cases where packages applications are small, the libraries still need to be downloaded.

## Extension/mistakes

Please contact me if you have any worthy extension and/or correction! I care about producing/spreading informed Ruby GUI development.

## Frameworks

### Shoes 3/4

Shoes was a neat library originally developed by why the lucky stiff. Its target was to allow users write cross platform application in Ruby style (traditionally, GUI development has always had a relatively low-level structure, so this was a big deal).

There have been two major turning points in the development:

- in 2010, Shoes 3 was released, following \_why's disappearance;
- in 2013, Shoes 4 was started, transitioning to a new underlying model; after some time, Shoes 3 was forked and got a separate maintainer.

Shoes 4 is based on JRuby/SWT, and it's at Release Candidate stage (but keep in mind that the development of Shoes has been traditionally very slow).

Shoes 3 is a mixed C/Ruby binding.

#### Distribution

From the distribution perspective, both v3 and v4 are very similar: they can produce self-contained packages (v3 will produce a native binary; v4 a JAR).

This is excellent for distribution:

- Shoes 3: one native binary per platform, no libraries needed;
- Shoes 4: a universal package; Java JRE is needed.

#### Functionality

In terms of general API richness, Shoes is a very limited toolkit. For example, events are attached to layout containers, not to widgets [ยน](#footnote01); there are basic widgets, but not all the typical ones present in mature toolkits (eg. tree list).

Shoes 3[.3.5] segfaulted after testing a handful of demo examples; Shoes 4 is more solid by design though, since it's backed by Java.

Shoes applications start slowly.

For the above reasons, I give a `poor` evaluation, although Shoes could still be an appropriate choice for trivial applications.

#### Documentation

The documentation of both v3 and v4 has a format appealing to beginners - flashy and friendly.  
Concepts are explained in a generally very limited (introductory) fashion; some miss examples in their chapters. There are examples for many widgets, though.  
In general, the documentation is not suited to (more) advanced development.

Shoes 4's documentation is outdated, which leads to a `poor` evaluation.

Shoes 3's documentation is unusually distributed; it's up to date, but it's readable only from the library main program (!). Gets a `so-so` evaluation for the basic, shared (with v4), content.

### FXRuby

FXRuby, based on the FOX toolkit, are the underdog of the GUI libraries - rarely mentioned, but active and very functional.

#### Distribution

In order to run a Fox Ruby application, the user needs to install the Fox Toolkit library and the `fxruby` gem. This is a reasonably easy process, thus, the `good` evaluation.

#### Functionality

The FOX toolkit is a mature and flexible library - there are professional applications making use of it.

FXRuby applications start quickly.

For the reasons above, FOX toolkit gets a `good` evaluation.

#### Documentation

The FXRuby documentation has a `good` evaluation, primarily because there is a [dedicated book](https://pragprog.com/book/fxruby/fxruby), which is old, but still valid. The (FXRuby) API documentation is also pretty good.

FXRuby examples are very thorough; there is even one dedicated to threading, which is a very delicate and generally overlooked problem (for example, Shoes and Tk don't mention it at all).

### Ruby-GNOME2

Ruby-GNOME2 is based on GTK+, which is a mature and flexibly library. It's extremely widespread.

Packaging GTK+ application seems to be very easy, therefore my `good?` evaluation.

I haven't developed with GTK+; due to the GTK+ backing, I gave a purely guessed `good?` functionality evaluation.

### qtbindings

Qt is a mature and flexible library. It's not only a GUI toolkit, but an entire application framework. It's extremely widespread.

Qt bindings development for Ruby has roots in [QtRuby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QtRuby); after the project died, [qtbindings](https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings) followed.

qtbindings supports Qt only up to an old version (4.8.6, released in 2014).

I haven't developed with Qt; due to the Qt backing, I gave a purely guessed `good?` functionality evaluation.

#### Distribution

qtbindings does not support the last release (4.8.7) of the supported version (4.8); also, it's very odd not to support Ruby 2.3 (which is a supported Ruby version) with the latest version of the gem.

This is somewhat messy, therefore, I assess `so-so`.

### Tk

Tk is a mature, flexible and widespread library; in fact, it's Python's standard.

Unfortunately, the Tk support library on Ruby is dead; it was the official Ruby library up to 2.3, then, its codebase has been split into a [separate gem](https://github.com/ruby/tk), which is now unmaintained.

The Tk sections have been kept for reference, although writing Ruby Tk applications for general distribution doesn't make sense anymore.

#### Functionality

Tk is a mature and flexible library.

The only exception is threading, which is obscure and poorly documented, so it's somewhat discouraged for applications making use of it.

Tk applications start slowly.

All in all though, functionality itself is `good`.

#### Documentation

Tk is vastly documented (with the mentioned exception of threading), and it has a very good (multi-language) tutorial, therefore, it gets a `good` evaluation.

### wxRuby

The Ruby binding project is dead! It's a shame, because the library is mature, flexible, and widespread.

## Conclusion

It's very difficult to give general guidelines, but I'll still give a shot.

For distributing applications, my guidelines are:

- for general purpose, FXRuby (also try GTK+);
- for *trivial* applications, try Shoes 3 (or 4, which right now is in RC).

The other libraries/bindings has very shortcomings that in my opinion/use cases are far too inconvenient.

<a name="footnote01">ยน</a>: I'm not sure if this can be worked around or not, for example by wrapping each evented widget in one container.
