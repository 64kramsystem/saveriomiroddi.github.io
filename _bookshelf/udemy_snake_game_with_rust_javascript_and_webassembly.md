description: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/snake-game-with-rust-javascript-and-webassembly">Udemy "Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner"</a><p/> Not a good course, unfortunately. The game merely exposes what the developer is typing, without any teaching in a strict sense; additionally, the code quality is not very good (I suspect that the author has little experience with Rust and/or game development). On the other hand, it can be useful for those who want to see how to wire a WASM project (it was for me).
