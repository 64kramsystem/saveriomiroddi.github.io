I'm the systems tech/team lead, backend programmer, and data model reverse engineer at Ticketsolve, which also sponsors a significant part of my open source development, studies and tech writing.

My icons in the computing field are John Carmack and Donald Knuth.

Public talks/papers:

- Sep/2021: Euromicro DSD conference: Co-author research paper "To Pin or Not to Pin: Asserting the Scalability of QEMU Parallel Implementation"
- Jan/2020: MySQL PreFOSDEM talk: "Friends let real friends use MySQL 8.0"

I have a public [development diary](https://github.com/saveriomiroddi/personal_notes/blob/master/extra/brojournal.md) for my open activity (the name is a satirical reference to the "brogramming" culture).

My boss described me in two strips:
