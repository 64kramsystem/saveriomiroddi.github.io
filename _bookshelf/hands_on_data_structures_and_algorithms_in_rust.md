description: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-rust">Udemy "Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust"</a><p/> A very interesting course, although the explain-while-typing style is not suited for the more complex topics, which would much benefit from a dedicated explanation.<br>Probably, a good choice for those familiar with the topics!
