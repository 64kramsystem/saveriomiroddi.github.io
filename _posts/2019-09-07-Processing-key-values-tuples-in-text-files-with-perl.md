title: Processing key/values tuples in text files with Perl (how to enable unattended upgrades for PPAs)

In my latest sysadmin experimentations, I've configured the unattended upgrades on my new server (an Odroid H2 üòç).

Among the other things, I had to add a PPA to the list of allowed origins to automatically upgrade. This required some interesting text processing, so I decided to dig into Perl's text processing functionalities.

This post describes how to enable unattended upgrades for a PPA, while explaining several useful Perl features, in particular, how to process key/value tuples; a few regular expression functionalities are also used.

## A high level overview of how to enable unattended upgrades for a PPA

The `unattended-upgrades` package is installed by default on Ubuntu Server installations, and takes care of upgrading the system, according to its configuration.

Not everything in the system is upgraded: only the configured origins, which are specified in the configuration file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`:

```
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
//      [other entries...]
};
```

Let's say we have the Libreoffice PPA installed (`ppa:libreoffice/ppa`); in order to find the corresponding origin, we need to dig into the apt state information files.

Each repository has a few files located under `/var/lib/apt/lists/`, with the relevant file ending with `_InRelease`. In this case, the target is `ppa.launchpad.net_libreoffice_ppa_ubuntu_dists_bionic_InRelease`, which contains the following data:

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Origin: LP-PPA-libreoffice
Label: LibreOffice Fresh
Suite: bionic
Version: 18.04
[other data...]
```

now we pick the `Origin` and `Suite` values, and add them to the `unattended-upgrades` configuration file:

```
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
        "LP-PPA-libreoffice:bionic";
//      [other entries...]
};
```

pretty simple. Now let's automate it.

## Premises, and structuring the procedure

The user needs to be aware of the difference of the two execution modes:

- `-n`: doesn't automatically print any output; the user must invoke `print`
- `-p`: in short, prints automatically the output

I'm also assuming some other concepts, whose explanations can be found in my previous [perl-related posts](/tag/perl) (and other tags).

### Capturing groups

First, let's start with regular expressions. We want to print the values corresponding to the keys `Origin` and `Suite`. Typically, we would just use the awk-style approach:

```sh
$ perl -lane 'print $F[1] if $F[0] =~ /^(Origin|Suite):/' /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_libreoffice_ppa_ubuntu_dists_bionic_InRelease
LP-PPA-libreoffice
bionic
```

however, for reasons explained later, we need to use capturing groups instead:

```sh
perl -lne 'print $1 if /^(?:Origin|Suite): (.*)/' /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_libreoffice_ppa_ubuntu_dists_bionic_InRelease
```

The notable concept here is the non-capturing group (`(?:Origin|Suite)`): it expresses a condition (`Origin` *or* `Suite`) that needs to match, but whose matching text is not captured; the second, regular, capturing group (`(.*)`) instead captures the text.

Since we have only one capturing group (the second), the corresponding variable is `$1`.

### Processing the input text as a single string

Text processing programs work, by default, by cycling on lines, and applying the specified operations on each line; therefore, we have a problem here: we can't process values on different lines.

In order to introduce the next concepts, we'll work temporarily on text replacement rather than match. The operator for replacing text is `s/<expr>/<expr>/`, very similar to the match (`/<expr>/`).

Let's suppose we have the input:

```
Key1: Value1
Key2: Val\
ue2
Key3: Value3
```

and we want to remove the tuple 2, which spans two lines. 

Perl can operate on the input text as a single string, using the (strange) option `-0777`, so we can easily execute:

```sh
$ perl -0777 -pe 's/Key2: Val\\\nue2\n//' <<'INPUT'
Key1: Value1
Key2: Val\
ue2
Key3: Value3
INPUT

Key1: Value1
Key3: Value3
```

There you go!

#### The "multiple lines" match operator modifier (`m`)

When working on a single string input, an interesting problem arises: what will the beginning/end of string metacharacters (`^`/`$`) refer to?

Let's see:

```sh
$ perl -0777 -pe 's/^Key1: Value1$//' <<INPUT
Key1: Value1
AltKey1: AltValue1
Key2: Value2
INPUT

Key1: Value1
AltKey1: AltValue1
Key2: Value2
```

It didn't work! The reason is that the `^`/`$` metacharacters refer to the beginning/end of the string. When we operate on a single string input, they will match the beginning/end of the entire input.

In order to apply the per-line behavior, we use the `m` match operator modifier:

```sh
$ perl -0777 -pe 's/^Key1: Value1$//m' <<INPUT
Key1: Value1
AltKey1: AltValue1
Key2: Value2
INPUT

AltKey1: AltValue1
Key2: Value2
```

now this worked as expected.

### The "global" match operator modifier (`g`)

This is straightforward: by default, substitution (and match) applies only once per processed string. If we want to replace multiple occurrences, we use the `g` modifier:

```sh
$ perl -pe 's/Vallue/Value/g' <<INPUT
Key1: Vallue1a Vallue1b
Key2: Value2
INPUT

Key1: Value1a Value1b
Key2: Value2
```

the same principle works for single-string input (`-0777`) mode.

### The join() function

The `join()` function is a standard tool in scripting languages; it takes a list and a string, and concatenates the entries of the former using the latter. In Perl, it has the signature:

```
join(<concatenator>, <list>)
```

We're going to produce the list using the match operator; since the purpose of `join()` is to concatenate multiple entries, we need to apply the `g` modifier to the match operator, otherwise, the match only returns one element.

Silly example; let's print the ingredients of a menu:

```sh
$ perl -0777 -ne 'print join(",", /[: ](\w+)/g)' <<INPUT
Pizza: flour mozzarella sauce
Pasta: pasta pesto
INPUT

flour,mozzarella,sauce,pasta,pesto
```

note that, simplicity's sake, we consider ingredients anything that is preceded by a space or a colon (`[: ]`).

### Adding a line to an input, after a match

There are many cases of additions to an input; in this case, we want to add a line after another line that matches a pattern.

Let's say we want to add an `A2` after `A` in the following example:

```
A
B
```

to:

```
A
A2
B
```

In Perl, this is simple, although not very readable. We simply use the variable containing the current line (`$_`) and concatenate (`.=`) the specified text:

```sh
$ perl -pe '$_ .= "A2\n" if /A/' <<INPUT
A
B
INPUT

A
A2
B
```

Easy!

## The final commands

Let's review the inputs:

```
# 
Origin: LP-PPA-libreoffice
Label: LibreOffice Fresh
Suite: bionic

Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
```

the series of logical steps to apply:

1. for the entire input, in a single string form,
1. find all the lines...
1. ...starting with `Origin` or `Suite`
1. for those lines, capture the value string after the key
1. join all the captured strings using a colon (`:`)
1. finally, insert the result in the apt info file

and the translation to the corresponding Perl concepts:

1. `-0777`
1. `/.../g`
1. `/^(Origin|Suite)/m`
1. `/(?:...): (.*)/`
1. `join(":", <tokens>)`
1. `$_ .= "<new_line>\n" if /<match_line>/`

Let's put it together:

```sh
$ APT_INFO_FILE="/var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_libreoffice_ppa_ubuntu_dists_bionic_InRelease"
$ UNATTENDED_UPGRADES_FILE="/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades"

$ export LIBREOFFICE_ORIGIN="$(perl -0777 -ne 'print join(":", /^(?:Origin|Suite): (.*)/mg)' $APT_INFO_FILE)"

$ echo $LIBREOFFICE_ORIGIN
LP-PPA-libreoffice:bionic

$ perl -i -pe '$_ .= "        \"$ENV{LIBREOFFICE_ORIGIN}\";\n" if /^Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins/' $UNATTENDED_UPGRADES_FILE

$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
[...]
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "LP-PPA-libreoffice:bionic";
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}";
[...]
```

Done!

## Conclusion

In this article we've put together many different concepts, in order to automate a text processing task.

Although the task is simple, reviewing the concepts involved, and adding a few new ones, is a very useful exercise. While in real world cases, it can be hard to quickly come up with a script, exercising for the sake of exercising has two effects:

1. it raises the complexity lower bound of problems that can be handled immediately (e.g., for sysadmins, ability to process logs);
2. it also raises the upper bound of those that require more effort (e.g., for devops, tooling).

This effectively increase the engineering skills.
