description: A terrible book. I didn't expected Abrash's level, but not such a superficial approach either&#58; a couple of chapters with simple Rust-related optimizations, and for the rest, very generic, or downright unrelated subjects (macros!?). It sadly follows the trend of baiting readers with an interesting subject, but offering very shallow content.
